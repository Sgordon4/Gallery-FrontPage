🗂 Nested folders, visual dividers, soft-links, and manual reordering for complete layout flexibility

🔐 Military-grade encryption with PIN-protected folders, hidden files, and per-file backup control

🏷️ Tag files and notes for cross-folder search and easy recall

✍️ Rich text notes with embedded links — perfect for journaling, research, or reminders

🌐 Direct links to external images, videos, and GIFs — no need to download everything
